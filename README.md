# Sorting-Algorithm-Benchmarker
Application that benchmarks a number of sorting algorithms

### Description:  
An application which can be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms. The chosen algorithms were: 
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort  

Arrays of randomly generated integers with different input sizes were used to benchmark the algorithms in order to test the effect of the input size on
the running time of each algorithm. 123 different input sizes were employed, beginning with 100, then 250, and increasing all the way up to 10,000.  

The running time (in milliseconds) for each algorithm is measured 10 times, and the average of the 10 runs for each algorithm and for each input size is output to the console when the program finishes executing.

### How to run:  
Upload file from src directory and run in your IDE of choice.
